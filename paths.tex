\section{Algorithms for paths}

A \emph{path} in a directed graph $\dirG = (V, E)$ is a series of vertices $P = \langle v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_m\rangle$ such that for every $0 \leq i < m$, $(v_i, v_{i+1}) \in E$. Such a path is \emph{maximal} if for every $u \in V$, $(u, v_0), (v_m, u) \notin E$. The weight of a path is defined as the sum of path edge weights. Denote by $h(\dirG)$ and $\tilde{h}(\dirG)$ maximum weights of a path and a maximal path in $\dirG$, respectively. [SZ: how should cycles be handled?]
